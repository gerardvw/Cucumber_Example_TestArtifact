# Cucumber-Java Skeleton

![](https://travis-ci.org/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton.svg)

This is the simplest possible build script setup for Cucumber using Java.
There is nothing fancy like a webapp or browser testing. All this does is to show you how
to install and run Cucumber!

----->>>>>> This is adjusted to make an example of creating a TEST jar file including all dependencies and running Cucumber tests from command-line <<<<<<------------------------

Most important changes:
- Moved testcode from test to main
- Added profile 'jar-with-dependencies' in pom making use of maven-assembly-plugin to create the test jar
- Added buildJar.bat for an example how to create the test jar
- Added runtests.bat for an example how to run this test jar

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a single feature file with one scenario. The scenario has three steps, two of them pending. See if you can make them all pass!

## Use Maven

Open a command window and run:

    mvn test

This runs Cucumber features using Cucumber's JUnit runner. The `@RunWith(Cucumber.class)` annotation on the `RunCukesTest`
class tells JUnit to kick off Cucumber.

## Use Ant

Open a command window and run:

    ant download
    ant runcukes

This runs Cucumber features using Cucumber's Command Line Interface (CLI) runner. Note that the `RunCukesTest` junit class is not used at all.
If you remove it (and the `cucumber-junit` jar dependency), it will run just the same.

## Use Gradle

Open a command window and run:

    gradlew test

This runs Cucumber features using Cucumber's JUnit runner. The `@RunWith(Cucumber.class)` annotation on the `RunCukesTest`
class tells JUnit to kick off Cucumber.

## Overriding options

The Cucumber runtime parses command line options to know what features to run, where the glue code lives, what plugins to use etc.
When you use the JUnit runner, these options are generated from the `@CucumberOptions` annotation on your test.

Sometimes it can be useful to override these options without changing or recompiling the JUnit class. This can be done with the
`cucumber.options` system property. The general form is:

Using Maven:

    mvn -Dcucumber.options="..." test

Using Ant:

    JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dcucumber.options="..."' ant runcukes

Using Gradle:

    gradlew -Dcucumber.options="..." test

Let's look at some things you can do with `cucumber.options`. Try this:

    -Dcucumber.options="--help"

That should list all the available options.

*IMPORTANT*

When you override options with `-Dcucumber.options`, you will completely override whatever options are hard-coded in
your `@CucumberOptions` or in the script calling `cucumber.api.cli.Main`. There is one exception to this rule, and that
is the `--plugin` option. This will not _override_, but _add_ a plugin. The reason for this is to make it easier
for 3rd party tools (such as [Cucumber Pro](https://cucumber.pro/)) to automatically configure additional plugins by appending arguments to a `cucumber.properties`
file.

### Run a subset of Features or Scenarios

Specify a particular scenario by *line* (and use the pretty plugin, which prints the scenario back)

    -Dcucumber.options="classpath:skeleton/belly.feature:4 --plugin pretty"

This works because Maven puts `./src/test/resources` on your `classpath`.
You can also specify files to run by filesystem path:

    -Dcucumber.options="src/test/resources/skeleton/belly.feature:4 --plugin pretty"

You can also specify what to run by *tag*:

    -Dcucumber.options="--tags @bar --plugin pretty"

### Running only the scenarios that failed in the previous run

    -Dcucumber.options="@target/rerun.txt"

This works as long as you have the `rerun` formatter enabled.

### Specify a different formatter:

For example a JUnit formatter:

    -Dcucumber.options="--plugin junit:target/cucumber-junit-report.xml"
